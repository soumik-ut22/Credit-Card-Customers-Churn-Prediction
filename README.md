# Credit-Card-Customers-Churn-Prediction
Development tree-based models in Pandas to predict customer churn with high accuracy and recall.

# Background of the project
Analyzed data to extract factors causing attrition in Credit Card customers of a localized bank for effective target marketing. 
The data included details about the customer as well as their credit card activity.
Based on the features provided in the dataset, we endeavored to understand the underlying factors surrounding credit card customer attrition (churn).
If enabled to predict when a customer may leave, a bank could take action that may convince these churning customers to stay. 

# Importance of the problem
We chose to analyze this question because of the large economic impact of churn on banks that offer credit cards. 
BCG research shows that American corporate banks annually lose 10% to 15% of gross revenue due to attrition alone. Thus, reducing this attrition rate, even marginally, would greatly increase annual performance for many corporate banks.
By understanding the key indicators of attrition, the bank can implement targeted improvements in their business processes and therefore increase retention rate. 
Banks with this knowledge can make more informed business decisions by determining the focus areas to increase their investments, such as an increase in digital marketing, an improvement in customer service, or an expansion in incentives for the at-risk customers.
